# Signal Interference Analyzer

## Project Description

The Signal Interference Analyzer reads user-defined parameters for two sinusoidal signals and performs the following:

- **Input Handling**: Collects amplitude, frequency, phase shift, and either fixed time or distance values for both signals.
- **Signal Generation**: Computes the individual waveforms based on user input using the sinusoidal wave equation.
- **Interference Analysis**: Calculates and visualizes the sum of the two signals in the:
  - Time domain at a fixed distance.
  - Distance domain at a fixed time.
- **Visualization**: Plots the individual signals and their resultant interference, with properly labeled axes and titles for clarity.

## Features

- **User Input**: Accepts parameters such as amplitude (A), frequency (f), phase (Ï•), and fixed values for time (t1) or distance (x1).
- **Waveform Plotting**: Uses Python plotting libraries to generate graphs of the signals and their combined effect.
- **Interference Types**: Demonstrates constructive and destructive interference based on the phase difference between the signals.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (with libraries like `matplotlib` for plotting)
- Basic knowledge of signal processing and digital communication concepts
